### [US Census Bureau TIGER/Line](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-geodatabase-file.html) (2022)

These highways are distinguished by the presence of interchanges and are accessible by ramps and may include some toll highways. Secondary roads are main arteries, usually in the U.S. highway, state highway, or county highway system. These roads have one or more lanes of traffic in each direction, may or may not be divided, and usually have at-grade intersections with many other roads and driveways."

## Census Block Groups (`block_groups`) ‚Äî üåè

### [US Census Bureau TIGER/Line](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-geodatabase-file.html) (2022)

From the US Census Bureau:Standard block groups are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-character census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003..., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to Block Group 3. Due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the decade, current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block group relationships. For example, block 3001 might move due to a census tract boundary change but the block number will not change, even if it does not still fall in block group 3. However, the GEOID for that block, identifying block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles because block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes."

### Fields
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `geoid` | character | 12-digit unique identifier for block group. |
| `stateid` | character | 2-digit unique identifier for state. |
